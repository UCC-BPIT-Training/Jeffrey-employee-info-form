## Instruction

### As a user, I should be able to easily submit an employee's personal information and emergency contact details

#### Acceptance criteria

- Registration form should have the following fields: `Name`, `Email`, `Role`, `Emergency Contact Person` and `Emergency Contact Number`
- All fields are required
- The form should have built-in validation checks to ensure that all required information is entered correctly and consistently so that data quality is maintained. Email and contact numbers should be validated. Role should have more than 2 characters.
- If any input is incorrect, an error message should be available to help me know what to correct.
- If all inputs are valid, remove all error messages and show a pop-up notifying the user of successful information submission

You are free to design your form.
